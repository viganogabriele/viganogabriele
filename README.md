## Hello there ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m Gabriele, a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student from Italy.

### About me  
I recently graduated from a scientific high school with a focus on applied sciences, where I discovered a strong passion for computer science. My journey into the digital world began in middle school with the Adobe Suite and has grown over the years through self-learning and programming projects.

Now, Iâ€™m studying Computer Engineering at university, eager to expand my knowledge and turn ideas into real solutions. Iâ€™m always open to connecting with professionals and companies in the IT field â€” ready to learn, collaborate, and grow.

Iâ€™m excited for the challenges ahead and committed to shaping my passion into a successful and impactful career in tech.
